Seong Kim's assignment for [Viking Code
School](https://www.vikingcodeschool.com)

## Specifications
- A list of songs with their names, artists, and sound URLs (the URLs will not be displayed, but are necessary for audio playback).
- The user can start playing a track.
- When the track is playing, one should actually be able to hear the track.
- The currently playing track should somehow indicate that it is indeed the currently playing track.
- Once a track is selected, it should appear in the status bar.
- The track should remain in the status bar when it is paused.
- The user can pause the currently playing track.
- When the track is paused, one should not be able to hear the trackâ€”with the exception of auditory hallucinations caused by particularly catchy songs (though this is highly unlikely due to our reliance upon RFM).
- The user can press the next and previous track buttons, and when they do this, the respective track should become the active track.
- Any play/pause buttons should visually toggle between their play and pause states, depending upon the current state of the music player.
