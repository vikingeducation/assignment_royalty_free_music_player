Royalty Free Music Player

A player for all of your royalty player needs! Not only do you
have the full functionality of a music player, you have the ability
to search the wonderful world of RFM.

The app allows you to add your own links, add via search bar, and
remove songs you are tired of.

Instead of an API, I experimented with Node.JS web scraping and
generated a JSON file with song's title, artist, and url. All scraped data is cleaned and ready to be used in the player.
